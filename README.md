# PCOS Detection using Machine Learning

This is a small project I worked on to explore how machine learning can be used in healthcare, specifically for detecting **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**. The idea is to use data and simple ML models to see if we can find patterns that might help in early diagnosis.

## About the Project
The notebook (`pcos.ipynb`) contains the full workflow:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset
- Exploring data with some visualizations
- Training machine learning models
- Checking how well the models perform

Itâ€™s not meant to replace real medical tests, but more of an academic project to understand how ML can be applied in this area.

## Tools and Libraries
I mainly used:
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy for handling data  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for graphs  
- Scikit-learn for the machine learning part  
- Jupyter Notebook to put everything together  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AravindMeesala397/PCOS.git
   ```
2. Move into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd PCOS
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pcos.ipynb
   ```

## Results
The models give basic evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
I also included some graphs to make it easier to understand the dataset and the results.

## Notes
- This project is mainly for learning and experimentation.  
- The dataset used is from public sources and research papers.  
- Suggestions and improvements are always welcome!
